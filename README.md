# HDFL: Hierarchical Decentralized Federated Learning  

A novel approach to **Federated Learning (FL)** that introduces a **hierarchical and decentralized** framework to mitigate the **single point of failure** issue in traditional FL architectures. This method improves **scalability, fault tolerance, and computational efficiency** while maintaining strong model performance across distributed clients.  

## ðŸš€ Key Features  
- **Hierarchical Coordination:** A multi-layered approach to federated aggregation, reducing the reliance on a central server.  
- **Decentralized Communication:** Nodes can collaborate efficiently using a peer-to-peer structure, enhancing system robustness.  
- **Game-Theoretic Optimization:** Inspired by cooperative game theory, ensuring fair and efficient model updates.  
- **Improved Time Complexity:** Optimized aggregation strategies to reduce training time in large-scale deployments.  
- **Resilience to Failures:** Eliminates the risk of a single point of failure while maintaining performance.
